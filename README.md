[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This is a Book Search Engine that was originally built with RESTful API. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It has been refactored by me to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.
